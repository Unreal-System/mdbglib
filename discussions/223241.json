I am current trying to use the MS Symbol Server with the library when getting the stack trace of a dump, however the symbols do not seem to be loading correctly, where as I am able to pass the exact same parameters as command line arguments in WinDbg, and I get the expected stack. Does anyone know of how one would accomplish this? I have tried with the following:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">string</span> dumpLocation = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">@&quot;C:\\MyCrash.dmp&quot;</span>;<br><span style=\"color:blue\">string</span> symbols = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">@&quot;SRV*C:\\websymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;&quot;</span>;<br>symbols + = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">@&quot;C:\\MyProject\\MyPDBFiles&quot;</span>;<br><span style=\"color:blue\">string</span> images = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">@&quot;C:\\MyProject\\Bin&quot;</span>;<br>Debuggee dbgObj = Debuggee.OpenDumpFile(dumpLocation, symbols);<br>dbgObj.ImagePath = images;<br>DbgFrame[] f2 = dbgObj.GetEventStackTrace();<br><span style=\"color:green\">// More code }} </span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br>Thank you in advance for any direction, <br>Dennis</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
